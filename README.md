I am an Engineering industry veteran, now building software for the digital world. My passion for innovation and technology solves customer problems and transforms vision into reality. I love to build things that can add value to other people's lives and in todays digital world, online is the place to do that.

I'm an enthusiastic teammate and a patient communicator. I have a near-compulsive desire to explore the unfamiliar. My favorite languages are Python & JavaScript, I also have experience with C & C#.
